Instructions for installing the Chained SMS extension.

Note: this extension is not yet 'ready for automated distribution', and you won't find it on CiviCRM's install extensions page unless you manually download it to your site, which you can do by following the steps below.

## Requirements

Chained SMS has been tested with CiviCRM 4.7. It will likely work with CiviCRM 4.6 as well if CiviSMS is fixed as suggested in  [CRM-17331](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-17331).

## Installation steps

1. Download the latest version of the extension from https://github.com/3sd/io.3sd.chainedsms/archive/master.zip<br/>
***OR***<br/>
cd to your extensions directory and git clone it as follows<br/>
`$ git clone https://github.com/3sd/io.3sd.chainedsms`
2. Once downloaded, enable the extension. For example via CiviCRM's manage extensions page.
3. Once enabled, navigate to the Chained SMS page that can be found in the Mailings menu.
