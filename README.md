# Chained SMS

Chained SMS is a CiviCRM extension that enables you to carry out automated conversations via SMS.

Conversations start with an outbound text from CiviCRM. Subsequent texts can then be sent dependent on the reply received to the first text. These couplets of outbound and inbound texts can be combined into longer chains (hence the name). Conversations can branch with different pathways based on the answers to previous questions.

Full documentation (including installation instructions) can be found at [https://docs.civicrm.org/chained-sms/en/master/](https://docs.civicrm.org/chained-sms/en/master/).
